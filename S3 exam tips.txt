[S3 versioning exam tips]

stores all versions of an object
great backup tool
once enabled, cannot be disabled, only suspended,
integrates with lifecycle rules
versioning's MFA delete capability

[cross region replication]

versioninig must be enabled
regions must be unique
files in existing bucket are not replicated automatically
you cannot replicate to multiple buckets or use daisy chaining this time
delete markers are replicated
deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated
understand what cross region replication is at at high level

[life cycle management]

canbe used in conjunction with versioning
applied to current and previous versions
following actions can be done:
	transation to standard - IA
	archive to glacier storage class
	permanently delete obj

[What is CDN]

CDN (content delivery network) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other web content to a user based on geographic locations of the user, origin of webpage, and a content delivery server

edge location - location where content can be cached, separate from AWS region/AZ, are all around the world now
origin - origin of files
distribution - name given to the CDN which consists of edge locations

= exam tips=
edge location - where content cached 
origin - origin of all files, s3 bucket, ec2 instance, ELB or route53, can be non-AWS
distribution - name given to the CDN, consists of a collection of edge locations
	web distributions - used for websites
	RTMP - used for media streaming
not just used for read, can be used for write. can be sent to the origin server.
objs are cached for life of the TTL (time to live)
you can clear cached obj, but you will be charged for it

[security and encryption]
by default, all buckets are private
setup access control using:
	- bucket policies
	- access control lists
s3 buckets can be configured to create access logs... can be done to another bucket

- encryption -
1. in transit
	sending to and from the bucket, secured using SSL/TLS (TLS is replacement to SSL)
	using HTTPS
2. at rest
	server side encryption:
		- s3 managed keys SSE-S3, each obj encrypted a key (AES256 encryption) [SSE-S3]
	server side encryption with Key Management Service (SSE-KMS):
		- similar to above, but have more adv
		- added protection to unauthorised access
	server side encryption with customer provide keys (SSE-C):
		- management is done by you
	client side encryption:
		- encrypt data on client side, then upload to S3

[Storage Gateway]
is a service that connects an on-premise software applications with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration between an org on-premises IT env and AWS' storage infrastructure. It's essentialy a virtual image... that connects to your cloud. Can connect to cloud through: Direct Connect, Internet, Amazon VPC

install it as a virtual machine image.... pushes the data upwards to the cloud

four types of storage gateway
	1. File Gateways (NFS), used for files, directly stored on S3
	2. Volumes Gateway (iSCSI) - block-based storage, virtual harddisk for blocks, not for flat files. not on S3
		- Stored Volumes: store entire copy of data on-premise
		- Cached Volumes: only latest data
	3. Tape Gateway (VTL): backup and archival data...use lifecycle maangement then

=File Gateway=
most unlikely to come up as newest. files are stored as objects in s3. accessed through a Network File System (NFS).

[Snowball]
started from import/export disk to acceleate moving large amounts of data into and out of AWS cloud using portable storage. At ReINVENT 2015, AWS released snowball

types:
- snowball
- snowball edge
- snowmobile

>> snowball
petabyte-scale data transport solution. address commmon challenges with large-scale data. 80TB snowball in all regions. Once the data transfer job has been processed and verified, AWS performs a software erasures of the Snowball appliance. 256 AES encryption on them. 

>> snowball edge
100 TB data transfer device, has onboard storage and compute capabilities. it's a small portable AWS data centers. can run lambda functions off them. 

>> snowmobile
massive sea container off the back of a huge truck. petabyte and exabyte scale data transfer. 100 petabytes per snowmobile. makes it easy to move massive volumes of data. 

== exam tips ==
- understand whta snowball is
- understand what import/export is
- Snowball can: import to S3, export from S3
- move glacier to S3, then move to snowball


[s3 transfer acceleration]
uses cloudfront edge network to accelerate your upload to s3. you will get a distinct URL to upload to.
