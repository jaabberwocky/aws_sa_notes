[Well Architeced Framework Whitepaper]

Released at re:Invent 2015. By werner vogels. Developed by Solutions Architecture team based on their experience helping AWS customers. Well architected framework is a set of questions that you can use to evaluate how well your architecture is aligned to AWS best practices.

Based on 5 pillars of the well-architected framework.
1. Security
2. Reliability
3. Performance Efficiency
4. Cost optimisation
5. Operational excellence

Structure of each pillar:
- design principles
- definition
- best practices
- key aws services
- resources (read up on more)

General design principles:
1. stop guessing your capacity needs
	- make capacity decision 
	- can scale automatically to meet demand
2. test systems at production scale
	- can create production-scale test environment on demand
	- do that using cloudformation
	- then tear it down
3. automate to make experimentation easier
	- use cloudformation to try new things
	- add/remove resources to see what effect that has
	- allows you to replicate services at a low cost
4. allow for evolutionary architecture
	- traditional: one time event, never really changes after a long time
5. data-driven architecture
	- can collect data on how architectural decisions have affected workflow
	- can make objective decisions on making improvements
6. improve through game days
	- schedule game days to simulate events in production
	- stand up a copy of your prod environment, then load test, make sure it doesn't fall over


= Security Pillar =

Design principles
- apply security at all layers
- enable traceability
	- should be able to trace how hackers entering
- automate responses to security events
	- what if someone is trying to brute force into SSH (22)
- focus on securing your system
	- links to shared responsibility model
- automate security best practices
	- take a base image like Amazon AMI, then harden it
	- institutions have guide on hardening your OS

Shared responsibility mode
- what is customer responsible for:
	- data
	- OS, network, firewall config
	- applications
	- data encryption
- aws:
	- AWS global infra
	- compute, storage, database and networking

definition
- security consists of 4 areas:
	- data protection
	- privilege management
	- infra protection
