[Databases Summary]

RDS - OLTP
	- SQL Server
	- MySQL
	- Postgres
	- Oracle
	- Aurora
	- MariaDB

DynamoDB - NoSQL
RedShift - OLAP (DWH)
Elasticache - in memory caching
	- memcached
	- redis

= RDS =
Difference between Multi-AZ and Read Replicas
	- Multi-AZ will automatically sync to another RDS instance in another AZ
	- automatic failover for multi-az

	- read replica: if application does alot of reads, they can read off the read replicas
	- can have up to 5 read replicas

Aurora
	- 2 copies of data contained in each AZ, min of 3 AZ, 6 copies of your data
	- designed to transparently handle the loss of up to two copies of your data
	- self-healing
	- 2 types of replicas:
		- Aurora replicas (up t0 15)
		- MySQL read replicas (up to 5)

= DynamoDB =
	- push button scaling : scale on the fly without downtime; RDS not so easy
	- noSQL, key-value pairs
	- stored on SSD storage
	- 2 types of consistency
		- eventual consistent reads (default)
			= when the data is not immediately consistent right after read (< 1 seconds)
		- strongly consistent reads

= RedShift DWH =
- single node (160 GB)
- multi nodes
	- leader node
	- compute nodes (up to 128 in num)

= Elasticache =
	- fast in memory
	- cache popular data to be read all the time
	- 2 types of engines:
		- memcached
		- redis
