[Additional Exam Tips]

this includes things from other students who have just passed.


= kinesis =
- fully managed service for real-time processing of streaming data at massive scale.
- used to consume big data
- stream large amounts of social media
- process large amounts of data:
	- store in redshift for BI
	- EMR for big data processing

= EC2 ebs-backed vs instance store =
- vol is virtual HD: EBS or instance store
- ebs: persistent (continue independently of the life of EC2)
	- can be detached and attached to others
	- use if you want it long-term
- instance store: NOT persistent (ephemeral storage)
	- cant take instance store and take put it in another EC2 instance
	- cant be stopped, if you do this data is wiped
	- shouldnt be used for long-term storage

= opsworks =
- orchestration service that uses Chef
- chef consist of recipes to maintain a consistent state
- look for keywords, terms "chef", "recipes", "cook books" think opsworks

= elastic transcoder =
- media transcoder in the cloud
- convert media files from original format to other stuff
- pay based on minutes you transcode and resolution at which you transcode

= SWF actors =
- workflow starters: an application that can initiate a workflow, could be your e-commerce website when placing an order
- deciders: control the flow of activity tasks in a workflow execution, if something has finished (or fails), a Decider decides what to do next
- activity workers: carry out the activity tasks

= get public IP of EC2 =
- curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
- key thing to remember is that it's an instances' metadata, and not user data

[Consolidated Billing]
AWS organisations and consolidated billing

~ what is it? ~
is an account managment service that allows you to consolidate multiple aws accounts into an organisation that you can crete and centrally manage.

available in two feature sets:
- consolidated billing
- all features

Root accoutns, and then organisational units, map

~ consolidated billing ~

paying account -> linked accounts (test/dev, production ,back office) -> one monthly bill, split into each account

paying account is indept and cannot access resources of other accounts, and all linked accounts are indept. currently a limit of 20 accounts.

= advantages =
- one bill per AWS account
- very easy to track charges and allocate costs
- volume pricing discount

= other things to note =
1. cloudtrail
	- per AWS accoutn and is enabled per region
	- can consolidate logs using s3 bucket
		- turn on cloudtrail in the paying account
		- create bucket policy for cross account ...

= exam tips =
1. consolidated billing allows you to get vol discounts on all accoutns
2. unused reserved instances for ec2 are applied across the group.
3. cloudtrail is on a per account and per region basis, but can be agg into a single bucket in the paying account

[AWS organisations]

centrally manage policies across multiple accounts
control access


--------------------------------------------------------------------

[cross account access]
many aws customers use separate aws accounts for their dev and prod resources. separate allows them to cleanly separate diff types of resources

cross account access makes it easier to work productively. easier to switch roles in AWS management console. then can easily switch w/o having to enter password and username
