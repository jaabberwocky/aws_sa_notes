[VPC Summary]

By far the HARDEST section of the course! TODO: setup a VPC from memory

We built out two subnets:
	1. public subnet
	2. private subnet

= NAT instances=

- disable source/destination check on instance
- NAT instance must be in a public subnet
- must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instnace
- scaled by size of instance

= NAT gateways =

- scaled up by themselves
- no need to patch
- update your route tables
- no need to disable destination/source checks
- more secure
- NOTE: create them in the PUBLIC subnet then associate the PRIVATE subnet to it!!

= internet gateways =

- must create when you create VPC, not created by default

= NACLs =

- VPC comes with default NACL which allows everything in and out
- can create custom NACLs, which denies all inbound/outbound traffic by default
- each subnet must be associated with a network ACL
- can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets, however subnet can be associated with only one NACL at any one time
- contain a numbered list of rules that is evaluated in order, starting with lowest numbered rule
- have separate inbound and outbound rules
- are stateless, security groups are stateful
- can block IP addresses using NACLs, but not with SGs

= ALB =

- need two public subnets at least to launch a ALB
	
= flow logs =

- cannot enable flow logs for VPCs that are peered with your VPC unless the peer VPC is in your account
- cannot tag a flow log
- after created, cannot change its configuration
- not all traffic are logged:
	- traffic generated by instances when they contact DNS server
	- generated by windows instance to check windows activation
	- 169.254.169.254 metadata check

= end points =

- can create an internal gateway in VPC to endpoints to AWS services such as S3
