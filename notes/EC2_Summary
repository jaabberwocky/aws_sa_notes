= Overview =
Learnt alot about:
	- EC2 instances
	- pricing
	- Serverless
	- Load balancers
	- Auto scaling group

Know differences in pricing:
	- on demand
	- spot (if spot > bid, then instances will terminate)
	- Reserved (reserve capacity, run from 12mths to 36mths, more pay out, more discount)
	- Dedicated hosts (for licensing, or for regulatory environments where you need physical separation)

Remember with spot instances:
	- if you termiante the instance, you pay for the hour
	- if AWS termiantes, you get the hour it was terminated in for free

= EBS =
Elastic Block Storage

EBS consists of:
	- SSD, general purpose - GP2 (up to 10,000 IOPS)
	- SSD, provisioned IOPS - IO1 (> 10,000 IOPS)
	- HDD, throughput optimised - ST1 - freq. accessed workloads
	- HDD, Cold - SC1 - less freq. accessed workloads
	- HDD, Magnetic - Standard - cheap, infreq. accessed storage

remember boot volumes can only be SSD or HDD magnetic standard.
Remember you cant mount 1 EBS vol to multiple EC2 instances, instead use EFS.

= EC2 Lab =

- Termination protection is turned off by default, must turn on
	- on EBS-backed instance, the default action is for the root EBS vol to be deleted when the instance is terminated
- EBS-backed Root can now be encrypted using AWS API or console to encrypt the boot volume, can also use 3rd party tools such as bit locker to encrypt the root
	- additional volumes can be encrypted

= vol vs snapshots =

- Volumes exist on EBS:
	- virtual HD
- snapshots exist on S#
- you can take a snapshot of a volume, this will store that volume on S3
- snapshots are point in time copies of volumes
- snapshots are incremental, means that only the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3
- if this is your first snapshot, may take some time to create as many files are being moved
- snapshots of encrypted vols are encrypted automatically
- vols restored from encrypted are encrypted automatically
- you can share snapshots, but only if they are unencrypted
	- can be shared with other AWS accounts

- to create snapshot for EBS root, should stop the instance before taking snapshot
- instance store volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage
- instance store volumes cannot be stopped, if the underlying host fails, you will lose your data
- EBS backed instances can be stopped, you will not lose the data if stopped
- you can reboot both, will not lose ata
- by default, both ROOT volumes deleted on termination, but if you use EBS, you can tell AWS to keep the root device vol if EBS-backed


= take snapshot of RAID array =

- problem: snapshots only take "image" of the disk, and not things in cache, which is problem with RAID arrays
- stop application from writing to disk
- flush all caches to disk
- freeze the file system
- unmount the RAID array
- stop EC2 instances

= Amazon Machine Images =

- AMIs are regional
- can only launch AMI from the region in which it is stored
- can copy AMIs to other regions using console, CLI or EC2 api


= Monitoring =

- Standard monitoring = 5 min
- Detailed monitoring = 1 min (cost more)

Cloudwatch is for performance monitoring
cloudtrail is for auditing


= Cloudwatch =

- Dashboards : create awesome dashboards to see what is happening
- Alarms: allow you to set alarms that notify you when particular thresholds arehit
- Events: cloudwatch events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources
- Logs: help you to aggregate, monitor and store logs


= Roles =

- FAR more secure than storing access key and secretkey on individual EC2 instances
- roles are easier to manage
- roles can be assigned to ec2 instance after it has been provisioned using both CLI and aws console (used to be only at creation)
- roles are universal, can use them in any region


= Instance meta-data =

- used to get info about an instance (such as public api)
- curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data


= EFS features =

- supports NFSv4 protocol
- only pay for storage you use
- can scale up to PB
- can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections
- great for fileserver
- data is tored across multiple AZs within a region
- read after write consistency


= Lambda =

compute servie to upload code, takes care of provisioning and managing the servers. event-driven compute service where AWS lambda runs your code in response to events

as an compute service to run your code in response to HTTP requests using amazon api gateway or API calls made during amazon sdk


= placement groups =

- two types of placement:
	- clustered placement group (think of this as default): used for big data
	- spread placement group: used to keep your critical ec2 instances to guaranteeing that they are on diff physical hardware
